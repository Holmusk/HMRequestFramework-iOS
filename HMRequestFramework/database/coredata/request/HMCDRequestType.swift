    /// context's delete(_:) method without it throwing an Error.
    ///
    /// For save/upsert, it's not possible to do this since most likely the
    /// data are not yet in the DB, and we cannot pass objects between contexts.
    /// Therefore, we can neither query the DB nor transfer the data to our
    /// own disposable context.
